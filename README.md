# Insulin2Image Estimator
### CS329S project
My team created an Image2Insulin application for diabetes patients to use and get thier insulin dosages.

Introduction:
Diabetes is a really prominent disease in society, with over 400 million having diabetes worldwide in 2017 (1.). Out of those that have diabetes, all of those that have type 1 (2.), about 20 million people, and some of those that have type 2 need to manually inject insulin for each meal they eat, based on the amount of carbohydrates (carbs) in the meal. This can be difficult, especially for those who newly got the disease or for those that are young. It requires those with diabetes to either learn the carb percentages of many different foods, or to look them up by hand each time they eat something. Our proposed solution is a computer vision based approach, where the amount of carb percentages can be calculated from a photo of a meal. We also calculate an estimated insulin dosage if the users input the weights of the different foods and their insulin factor. Our solution can therefore speed up insulin dosage calculation and does not require any manual calculation using the insulin factor, which makes the day-to-day life of those with diabetes easier.
